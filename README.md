# Seven segment counter

In this project a STM32-Smart-v2.0 consisting an STM32f103c8t6 ARM microcontroller is used to build a simple circuit comprised of a push button and a common cathode seven segment. 
While running,with each push of the button the seven segment count increases by one and when the count reaches 9,the count resets to 0. 
This ARM program was built with Keil and STM32Cube.
Also you can contact me if you are in need of the whole project and it's files.
